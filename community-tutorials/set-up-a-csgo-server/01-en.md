# Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) server on your netcup server. CSGO is a popular multiplayer first-person shooter game, and running your own server allows you to customize gameplay, play with friends, or even host community tournaments.

Before you begin, please make sure you have a netcup server with the appropriate resources to handle a game server. It's recommended to have a vServer or dedicated server with sufficient CPU, RAM, and bandwidth for smooth gameplay experience. Although the VPS 200 G10s should suffice for a few players, it is more advisable to go for the VPS 500 G10s due to more RAM and CPU cores.

# Requirements
- A netcup server (vServer or dedicated server)
- Basic knowledge of working with Linux command line.


# Step 1 - Install SteamCMD
   
   SteamCMD is a command-line tool used to install and update game servers. Follow these steps to install it on your netcup server:
   
   - Connect to your server via SSH using a terminal or SSH client.
   - Update the package list:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     ```
   - Install SteamCMD:
     ```
     sudo apt install steamcmd
     ```
   
# Step 2 - Create a Dedicated User
   
   It's recommended to create a dedicated user for running the CSGO server. This improves security and separates game server files from system files. Follow these steps to create a new user:
   
   - Create a new user named "csgoserver":
     ```
     sudo adduser csgoserver
     ```
   - Set a secure password for the new user and provide any additional information if prompted.
   - Grant sudo privileges to the user (optional):
     ```
     sudo usermod -aG sudo csgoserver
     ```

# Step 3 - Log in as the Dedicated User
   
   Switch to the newly created "csgoserver" user to perform the remaining setup steps:
   
   - Log in as the "csgoserver" user:
     ```
     su - csgoserver
     ```
   - Enter the password for the "csgoserver" user.

# Step 4 - Install CSGO Server
   
   Now, you can use SteamCMD to install the CSGO server on your netcup server:
   
   - Create a directory to store the CSGO server files:
     ```
     mkdir csgo-server
     cd csgo-server
     ```
   - Download and install the CSGO server using SteamCMD:
     ```
     steamcmd +login anonymous +force_install_dir ./csgo-server +app_update 740 validate +quit
     ```
   - Wait for the installation to complete. This may take some time depending on your server's resources and network speed.

# Step 5 - Configure the Server
   
   The CSGO server configuration files allow you to customize various aspects of the gameplay, such as server name, game mode, and player limits. Here's how you can configure the server:
   
   - Navigate to the server configuration directory:
     ```
     cd csgo-server/csgo/cfg
     ```
   - Create a new file named "server.cfg" using a text editor:
     ```
     nano server.cfg
     ```
   - Add your desired server configuration settings to the file. Here's an example:
     ```
     hostname "My CSGO Server"
     sv_password ""
     mp_maxplayers 16
     ```
   - Save the file and exit the text editor (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+X in nano).

# Step 6 - Start the CSGO Server
   
   It's time to start your CSGO server and make it accessible to players:
   
   - Return to the main CSGO server directory:
    

 ```
     cd ~/csgo-server
     ```
   - Start the server with the desired launch options and server configuration:
     ```
     ./srcds_run -game csgo -console -usercon +game_type 0 +game_mode 1 +mapgroup mg_active +map de_dust2 -tickrate 128
     ```
   - The server will start, and you'll see the console output in the terminal. It may take a few moments to initialize the server.

# Step 7 - Connect and Test
   
   Your CSGO server is now running, and you can connect to it to test its functionality:
   
   - Launch the CSGO game on your computer.
   - Open the console by pressing the tilde (~) key.
   - Type the following command to connect to your server:
     ```
     connect your_server_ip:27015
     ```
     Replace "your_server_ip" with the IP address of your netcup server.
   - Press Enter, and you should connect to your CSGO server.

# Step 8 - Further Configuration
   
   This tutorial covered the basic setup of a CSGO server, but there are many additional configuration options and plugins you can explore to enhance your server. You can modify server settings, install custom maps, enable plugins, and more. Refer to the official CSGO server documentation and community resources for more information.

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully set up a CSGO server on your netcup server. You can now invite your friends or community members to join and enjoy the game. Remember to maintain your server by keeping it updated, monitoring for any issues, and adjusting the configuration based on your preferences and player feedback.

Feel free to explore advanced server configuration options and plugins to further customize your CSGO server. Enjoy playing and hosting exciting matches on your own dedicated server!
